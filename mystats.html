<h1>Gutti Vankaya is My favorite dish.</h1>
<p>Gutti vankaya kura is a stuffed eggplant dish from the Andhra cuisine. 
    Here the stuffing is made from a mix of desiccated coconut, peanuts and spices, which is ground finely. 
    Small tender brinjals are stuffed with this ground masala and then cooked.
     A bit of tamarind pulp is added to the gravy for a faint sour taste.
